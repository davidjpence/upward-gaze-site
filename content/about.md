# About

At the end of the book of Matthew, we are instructed by our Lord Jesus to share his message and make disciples of all nations. At this ministry, we intend to do just that. We strive to strengthen believers and prepare them to fulfill the great commission, make new disciples, and grow in sanctification ourselves.

To achieve these goals, we write articles that are published on this website. In these articles we discuss a variety of topics from theology to world events.

In all we do, we seek to be rooted in scripture.

# Statement of Faith
## Scripture
The Bible is the divinely inspired, infallible word of God. It is the ultimate authority and source of truth for all believers. God used men to deliver his word, he preserved that word, and that word is sufficient to know God. All teaching should start with scripture, and anything that contradicts or adds to scripture is false teaching. *(2 Peter 1:21, 2 Timothy 3:16)*

## God
### Trinity
There is one sovereign God who rules over all creation. He is intimately familiar with every atom, exists eternally without beginning or end, and is fully self-sufficient. He relies on nothing outside of himself, and has perfect relationships within the three persons of the trinity—the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The trinity does not mean there are three gods; there is one God with one nature, but with distinct persons with distinct roles. God works out all things through his perfect will, in order to bring himself the most Glory. *(John 10:30, Matthew 28:18-19, Ephesians 4:4-6)*

### Father
The Father is the creator and ruler of all things through the Son, Jesus Christ. He providentially directs the world in accordance with his perfect will, acting with perfect justice and righteousness. All creatures owe their love, reverence, and obedience to Him. He abounds in steadfast love, but will not let the guilty go unpunished. *(Exodus 34:6-7, Deuteronomy 6:4-5, Psalm 47:2, 8, Isaiah 45:5, Jeremiah 10:10, 1 Corinthians 8:4-6, Revelation 4:11)*

### Son
The son is the Christ, who has eternally existed and through whom all things were made. He added a human nature to his divine nature when he was born of a virgin and walked the Earth. In his life he faced temptation as we do, but was without sin. Despite that, he voluntarily submitted to the will of the father and died a sinner’s death on the cross to provide salvation for his people. After three days in the grave, he rose again, defeating death and satisfying the wrath of God in our stead. He lives on as mediator between God and man, head of the Church, and will one day judge the world in righteousness. *(John 1:3, 10:30, 14:9, Luke 24:38-39, Romans 3:23-25, 4:25, 5:8, 2 Corinthians 5:21, Philippians 2:5-11, Hebrews 1:3, 4:15, 1 Peter 1:18-19)*

### Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit is sent by the Father and Son to convict the world of Sin and carry out God’s redemptive work. He regenerates people and indwells himself in believers, justifying and sanctifying them. He empowers believers to perform good works and live a Godly life. His presence is evident by the fruit of the Spirit and the building up of believers into the body of Christ. *(John 14:26, 16:8-9, Acts 1:8, 2:38, Romans 8:9, 1 Corinthians 6:19, 12:12-13, Ephesians 1:13-14)*

## Humanity


Humanity was made in the image of God for the purpose of glorifying him. We were designed to rule over and subdue the Earth while living in relationship with God. After the fall, we were corrupted with a sin nature. That sin nature totally affects our thoughts and actions, leading to total depravity and moral corruption.

Humanity was designed male and female. Gender is chosen by God and is known from the moment of conception. To say otherwise, or to try to change your gender is an abomination and an attempt to play god. Sexual and romantic relationships were designed for one man and one woman within the bounds of marriage. Marriage is a beautiful gift from God that is lifelong and illustrates how God relates to His people.

Through marriage and the bearing of children, the family is created. Within the family, men must be strong protectors, spiritually leading and providing for their family—giving their lives if they must. Men must not be harsh with their wives, but gentle and loving. Wives must submit to their husbands; not passively going along with everything they say, but recognizing their God-given role as the leader. Children must submit to the authority of their parents, and the parents must disciple the children, teaching them to love and obey God.

Life begins at conception and slaughtering children in the womb is murder. *(Genesis 1:26-31, 2:15-25, Jeremiah 1:5, 1 Timothy 2:12-3:13, Galatians 3:23-29, Ephesians 5:22-33, 1 Peter 4:10-11)*


## Sin
In the garden, Adam and Eve were given a single rule: do not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They ate of the tree, bringing sin and death into the world. Humanity is now corrupted with a sin nature. We rebel against God as easily as we breathe. We are totally depraved and morally corrupt. Every man deserves to face God’s wrath.

Because God is good, he hates evil. Therefore he will bring justice to sinners. On judgement day, those whose name is not found in the book of life will be cast into hell, where they will face torment in the presence of the Christ. This is necessary for a good God—he cannot turn a blind eye to sin. *(Genesis 3, Psalm 5:4-6, Isaiah 61:8, Jeremiah 17:9, Romans 3:10-12, 8:7-8, Ephesians 2:1-3, Revelation 14:10, 20:12-15)*

## Salvation
While man is deserving of God’s wrath, God decided, in his love, to save some. His wrath was poured out on Jesus instead of his people. When judgment day comes, he will look upon those who are saved as though they are righteous. This is something that could never be earned; it is a gracious gift of God. *(Matthew 20:28, John 3:16, 2 Corinthians 5:21, Ephesians 2:8-9)*

### Election
Man does not have the capability to repent of their sin without God’s intervention. God knew who he would intervene for before he laid the foundations of the Earth, and he works out all things for the good of those elect—meaning the elect will hear the gospel, repent, and through the events of their life, become sanctified. People are not elected to salvation based on their own merit, works, likability, or anything else; it is purely an act of mercy from God. *(John 6:44, Romans 8:7-8, 8:28-30, 9:15-16, Ephesians 1:4-5)*

### Regeneration
Regeneration is the first step of salvation, and what we refer to as “being born again.” This is the moment when God opens the eyes of a believer, giving them a heart of flesh and a new nature capable of placing their faith in Him. *(Ezekiel 36:26-27, 2 Corinthians 5:17)*

### Justification
Justification is the moment when a believer puts their faith in Christ and their sin is forgiven. In an instant, all of their sins are atoned for and God no longer looks at them as a sinner, but as if they possessed Christ’s righteousness. Works play no part in justification, it is the work of God accepted through faith. It is the second step of salvation. *(Luke 13:3, Romans 8:33, 2 Corinthians 5:21, 7:10, Ephesians 2:8-9)*

### Sanctification
Sanctification is the lifelong process of growing in godliness. Unlike the other two steps of salvation, works are of utmost importance in sanctification. True saving faith will produce a desire to do good works and live in a way that glorifies God. Every true believer will be sanctified over the course of their life with the help of the Holy Spirit, but sanctification will never be completed until we die. *(1 Corinthians 6:11, 2 Corinthians 3:18, Philippians 1:6, 1 Thessalonians 4:3, Hebrews 12: 14, James 2:14-17)*

## The Great Commission
The final commandment given by Jesus in Matthew 28:16-20 is the Great Commission, and fulfilling it is the goal of this ministry. Jesus instructs us to go to all creatures, share the gospel, and teach them to observe his commands. Making disciples of Christ is the primary work of Christians and the church. Sharing the news of eternal life is the best way to love God and others.

Sharing the gospel will never return void; people will either be moved by the Holy Spirit toward salvation, or they will hear the message, reject it, and harden their hearts. No one hears the gospel and remains unchanged. We do not know how people will react and we do not know who is one of God’s elect, which is why it’s our duty to faithfully preach the gospel to everyone. We do not need to worry about salvation—that’s God’s job—we just need to worry about getting the message out. *(Isaiah 55:11, Hebrews 4:12)*
