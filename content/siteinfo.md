title: "Site Information"

This website was built from scratch with the static website generator Hugo. The website makes no calls to Google, or any other privacy-invasive service. This means everything, including fonts and images, are hosted by UpwardGaze.

In its current state, this website uses absolutely no JavaScript and no tracking. In the future, we may decide to implement analytics. If we make this decision, we will use a privacy-respecting, self-hosted, and lightweight solution--most likely Umami. We will never collect or sell personal information.

You can view the source code for this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/davidjpence/upward-gaze-site/tree/master). The code for this website is open source, however, the content of the website (articles, our logo, etc.), are property of Upward Gaze.

Articles can be freely quoted with proper citations.
